I know that I love these two sports and I will continute to do whatever it takes to become good at both of them. I say sports because that is exactly what they are -mind games. I will master both. Math started in the sumer before 8th grade and Computer Science, I am finally realizing what it is all about and I will continue to get better at both over time, I know it and I believe it.
