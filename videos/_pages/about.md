This is exciting even though this is just a stupid little website, slowly I will become so much better once i understand exactly what is required of myself.

>If only I had the Theorems! Then I should find proofs easily enough. -Bernhard Riemann

I dream of becoming good at math and being able to customize this website is one part of that and I need to continue to move foward and make sure that I do that. I am most passionate about combinatorics and number theory but other fields of math also equally attract me as well.

After riding my bike throughout the past month and over the past year I feel like i have madea huge leap forward and I am never going back. I feel that I have done something that no one else has ever done and that gives me the sense of a great accomplishment, something for me to be proud of for the rest of my life and I can never forget what I have done and what I need to get done in the future. I know that this is the start of something big. Once I have my website up and running everything else will follow eventually. I know it.

The educational system may use a combination of formal, informal horrible messages. What they do to people my age is pretty unthinkable and it is crazy how they are allowed to continue to do what they do with no regard for human life. They should not be tolerated but for some reason they are and that just is not right. It just is not.
